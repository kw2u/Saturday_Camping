We'll kick off the day with a meet in downtown Portland for the ride out. The tentative time for departure right now is 9:30am. We'll take 2-3 breaks along the way, it's got a few climbs on the way out, so best to pace ourselves. Pending all goes to plan, we'll arrive just after 12:30. However it might be around 1 or 1:30 depending on our pace.

As for camping, bring your gear, and whomsoever wants to can camp out with all the cool camping kids! For those that camp, we'll roll back the next day into Portland to join the city folk. If you'd like, you're more than welcome to just hang out for the day and head back whenever you want - we might even organize a return trip for both days pending participation.

So get RSVP'd and we'll start coordinating all the awesome.

Cheers!
